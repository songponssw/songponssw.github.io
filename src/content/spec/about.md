### Greeting üòÅ
<small>

> Hi everyone!! Thanks a lot for visiting my homepage! Here you'll find my journey on computer science/engineering path. I'm passionate about computer systems and got my start as a Linux administrator during undergrad at the [HCPNC labs](https://hpcnc.in.th/member/). Later, I worked as a system administrator at VISTEC before continuing my master's degree at TGGS.
>
>In 2025, I applied for GSoC with the Lima project. Even though I wasn't selected, I began contributing and gained valuable experience thanks to the maintainers' feedback. I also tried the [LFX Linux Kernel Mentorship](https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/lkmp). While I didn't pass, the prerequisite tasks gave me practical tools and a deeper understanding of Linux kernel development.
>
>On the other hand, I've been building projects and skills to prepare myself for future work:
> - Project A: ...
> - Project B: ...
> - I also started writing blogs to share my experiences and lessons learned along the way.
>
> This year, 2025, I‚Äôll graduate with a degree in Computer Engineering from TGGS. I‚Äôd love to work on exciting projects and with teams where my skills can truly fit and grow.
