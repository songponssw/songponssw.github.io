### Hi everyone !!!

<small>

> Thanks a lot for visiting my homepage! Here you'll find my journey realted to computer field.
> Over 7 years of experience, I build, debug, and monitor programs on Linux-based systems. From setting up applications in virtualization or container environments to analyzing how performance changes under different conditions, I focus on understanding system behavior. With my **HPC background**, I strive to squeeze out peak performance and deepen my understanding of how computers work, especially CPUs, memory, and operating systems. During my master’s degree, I dedicated time to exploring these interests further, expanding into **computer architecture, operating systems, and serverless technologies** through lab discussions and collaboration with colleagues.
>
> I also have experience in Federated Learning, particularly in deployment and communication within FL systems.
> Apart from academic work, I recently **contributed to open-source development (Lima, a CNCF project)** to step into the industrial world and production-grade coding. I did applied to GSoC with the Lima project and [LFX Linux Kernel Mentorship](https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/lkmp) but I was not selected. However, these applications encouraged me to continue contributing to open-source projects and the Linux kernel. Currently, I’m catching up with the latest DevOps tools, focusing on monitoring and observability (Prometheus, Loki, OpenTelemetry).
